## üìù Description

In Unity 2018.3, the Unity Package Manager (UPM) introduced Git support, providing a convenient way to install packages
from code hosting services such as GitHub. However, certain limitations and shortcomings were identified, including:

- Incorrect links to documents (readme, changelog, license)
- Lack of a direct link to the repository URL
- Limited functionality for adding, updating, and removing packages through the UI

This project addresses these issues by extending the UI of the Unity Package Manager for packages installed using Git.

### Features

- Direct link to the Git repository URL
- Links to offline documents, including:
    - Documentations
    - Changelog
    - License
- Support for various Git hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, etc.
- Installation of packages from Git repository URLs using the UI
- Updating packages with a specific tag/branch
- Removing packages
- Compatibility with Unity 2018.3 or later
- Support for `.Net 3.5`, `.Net 4.x`, and `.Net Standard 2.0`
- Version filtering
- Support for path query parameters (for Unity 2019.3.4f or later)
- (Version 2.0.0) Git repositories are cached, and installed/searched packages are automatically indexed:
    - Cached repositories are shared between different projects
    - Cached repository URLs are displayed as history in the installation window
    - Indexed packages are shown in `My Registries`
- (Version 2.0.0) Additional menu options to open `manifest.json` with a code editor, open the cache directory, clear
  the cache, and fetch packages:

## ‚öô Installation

This package requires as following:

- **v1.x**: Unity 2018.3 to 2019.4
- **v2.x**: Unity 2020.1 or later

#### Install via OpenUPM

This package is available on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com) package registry.
This is the preferred method of installation, as you can easily receive updates as they're released.

If you have [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli) installed, then run the following command in your
project's directory:

```sh
# for Unity 2020 or later
openupm add com.coffee.upm-git-extension
# for Unity 2018 or 2019
openupm add com.coffee.upm-git-extension@v1 
```

#### Install via UPM (using Git URL)

Navigate to your project's Packages folder and open the `manifest.json` file. Then add this package somewhere in
the `dependencies` block:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // for Unity 2020 or later
    "com.coffee.upm-git-extension": "https://github.com/mob-sakai/UpmGitExtension.git",
    // for Unity 2018 or 2019
    "com.coffee.upm-git-extension": "https://github.com/mob-sakai/UpmGitExtension.git#v1",
    ...
  },
}
```

To update the package, change suffix `#{version}` to the target version.

* e.g. `"com.coffee.upm-git-extension": "https://github.com/mob-sakai/UpmGitExtension.git#2.1.0",`
